This is a Minecraft style voxel game engine written in C# using an OpenGL wrapper with support for multiplayer and designed to be easily expanded with support for custom textures and modular code.
I made this a year or so ago to learn basic graphics, networking and working with the data types found in games such as Minecraft.
I am working on a newer version with much smaller voxels and path tracing that I intend to upload when its in a less buggy state.
